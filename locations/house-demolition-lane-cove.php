                        <h2>Our House Demolition Lane Cove Process</h2>
                        <div class="wt-separator bg-primary"></div>
                        <p>The house demolition process can be daunting as there are a range of things which need to be considered if this is your first house demolition project. This is not something which should be undertaken yourself, but you can take comfort in the knowledge that we have significant experience and have successfully performed a house demolition Lane Cove service more times than we can count.</p>
                        <p>We have dedicated staff members whose sole job is to help you. Before starting we explain the process from start to finish and outline the timeline of what to expect. The time-frame will vary depending on the size of the job and any preparation which needs to be undertaken beforehand. During this phase we request any information we need from you and explain exactly what you can expect from us.</p>
                        <p>On receiving a client confirmation, our experienced office staff will commence with arranging all paperwork and liaise with the client. We will then help the client complete all applications and lodge them successfully to the council.</p>
                        <img class="alignright" src="/images/house-demolition/house-demolition-lane-cove-2.jpg" alt="House Demolition Lane Cove Process">
                        <p>Unless you are familiar with the system, dealing with local councils can be confusing. When an application is filled out incorrectly it is often dropped to the bottom of the pile, but we understand what local councils are looking for and handle all the paperwork for you. This can significantly speed up your application and could potentially save you weeks of waiting in frustration.</p>
                        <p>When the application is approved from the council, we then arrange an on-site meeting with the client and our operations manager. We will then arrange for all the relevant disconnections to be finalised, such as power, gas, sewer cut, and seal and septic decommission.</p>
                        <p>Following this, the demolition is then scheduled, and we advise the client of the impending time-frame. If asbestos is present on the property, our licensed asbestos removal professionals will prepare an asbestos removal control plan before the demolition. Our professionals will then commence with the removal of the existing structure and carefully remove all waste from the site.</p>
                        <p>Once the house demolition is complete, you need to obtain the following documents: Asbestos clearance certificate from an independent licensed asbestos assessor or independent competent person. A copy of the qualification for that licensed asbestos assessor/competent person. Copies of the receipts for the disposal of asbestos at an approved asbestos disposal depot. Confirmation/ sign-off from your council or relevant certifier that the demolition has been completed.</p>
                        <p>Our dedicated staff members will assist you with all required documents. It is all the finer details which can easily be overlooked which we pride ourselves in, our demolition personnel work with precision to ensure the process is smooth and seamless for our valued customers. At the end of the project the site will be left clean with all appropriate documentation and permits. All in all, the work carried out on the site will be done in accordance with Australian Standards, Regulations, and Codes of Practice.</p>

                        <p>House demolition debris isn&apos;t like everyday waste you can simply toss in your trash can and have taken away by your local trash hauler. When you have bulk amounts of debris you will need to handle disposal differently. Waste removal is always the time sensitive and costly process of getting rid of leftover debris. Concrete, wood, steel, tiling and drywall all can be extremely difficult to haul off of a construction site.</p>
                        <p>Gabrael House Demolition provides an efficient and safe house demolition waste disposal service so you don&#x2019;t need to worry about the pick up or disposal of the debris during and after the house demolition Lane Cove project is complete. Our professionals will ensure that the demolition debris is out of your way so that you can get on with the development of the land.</p>
